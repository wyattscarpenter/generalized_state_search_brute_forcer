"""Hi, welcome to the readme, which is just symlinked to the main.py file.
This is Wyatt S Carpenter's generalized state search brute forcer, a program which implements a common pattern I've often seen and need.
Given a production rule, an initial state, and a desired state, this program uses a breadth-first search on the state space to find a solution (also: guaranteed to be one of the shortest solutions, funny enough!
(COULD: one day give it a "cost function" as well, and minimize that instead of steps. But hey. Why bother?).
This program uses a brute-force method and also is written in Python, so I hope you have a lot of RAM, and a lot of time on your hands!
This program requires Python 3.12 or later, but purely in order to use the Type Parameter Syntax (the def foo[T]() type thing). You can just scrape that syntax off if you want to use it in earlier pythons.

  """This function searches state space starting from initial_state until it finds desired_state. May take a while.
  Return value is a list of states from initial to desired. No information about which rules were used is returned. (COULD: extend the program to do so.)
  The type S is meant to stand for State, and represents whatever type you bring to the table for that, like a dict or whatever. S *must* be hashable, except that for common builtin unhashable datatypes (dict, set, list) I've already built-in a workaround, so you can just use those anyway.
  The production rule should be one function that, given a state, returns all the possible resulting states. For instance, all the possible states of a chess board after a move is made in the current state.
  Hot tip: you can prevent the production rule from emitting invalid states entirely OR just make all invalid states map to an error value, like {"I am error"} that can never make it to the desired state. It's all the same to the program."""
